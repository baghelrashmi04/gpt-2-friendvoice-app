# GPT-2 Text Generation Web App (Mimicking a Specific Style)

## Overview

This project involves fine-tuning a GPT-2 language model to generate text that mimics the conversational style of a specific individual. A user-friendly web application, built with Streamlit, provides an interface to interact with the fine-tuned model by inputting prompts and adjusting generation parameters.

## Goal

The primary goal was to create a text generation model that could capture and reproduce the unique linguistic patterns, vocabulary, and sentence structures of a particular person's writing or speech.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Hugging Face Transformers:** A powerful library for working with pre-trained language models.
    * **GPT-2:** The base language model used for fine-tuning.
    * **AutoTokenizer:** For encoding and decoding text.
    * **GPT2Config:** For loading the model configuration.
    * **GPT2LMHeadModel:** For the language generation model.
    * **Trainer (Implicit):** Used during the fine-tuning process (though the code here focuses on inference).
* **Streamlit:** A Python library for creating interactive web applications quickly.
* **Safetensors:** For efficiently and safely loading the model weights.
* **PyTorch:** The underlying deep learning framework used by Transformers.
* **GitHub:** For version control and hosting the project.

## Setup and Running the Application

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_github_repository_url>
    cd gpt2-friend-voice-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Obtain Model Weights:**
    **Important:** Due to the size of the fine-tuned model weights (`model.safetensors`), this repository does **not** include them directly. You will need to obtain these weights separately and place the `model.safetensors` file inside the following directory structure within the repository:
    ```
    ./output/checkpoint-3/
    ```
    The `config.json` file should also be present in this directory.

    * **If you fine-tuned the model yourself:** Ensure your training process saved the `model.safetensors` and `config.json` files in the specified location.
    * **If the weights are shared through another means:** Follow the instructions provided to download and place them correctly.

4.  **Run the Streamlit Application:**
    Navigate to the root directory of the repository in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This will open the web application in your default web browser.

## Usage

1.  Once the application is running in your browser, you will see a text area where you can enter your prompt.
2.  Use the sliders to adjust the text generation parameters:
    * **Temperature:** Controls the randomness of the output (lower values are more deterministic).
    * **Number of Generations:** Specifies how many different text sequences the model will generate for a single prompt.
    * **Max Length:** Sets the maximum number of tokens in the generated text.
3.  Click the "Generate Text" button to see the model's output based on your prompt and the selected parameters.
4.  The generated text will be displayed below the button, with each generation separated by a horizontal line.

## Challenges and Learnings

Throughout this project, several challenges were encountered and overcome:

* **Model Loading Issues:** Initially faced errors related to incorrect file paths and the `safetensors` format, which required careful path verification and using the `safetensors` library.
* **Model Architecture Mismatch:** The "Missing key(s) in state\_dict" error highlighted the importance of aligning the model architecture (`GPT2LMHeadModel`) with the saved weights.
* **Repetitive Text Generation:** The model sometimes produced repetitive sentences, which was addressed by adjusting generation parameters such as `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `no_repeat_ngram_size`, and `repetition_penalty`.
* **Locating Tokenizer Files:** Difficulty in finding the saved tokenizer files led to the solution of directly loading the pre-trained `gpt2` tokenizer.

Key learnings from this project include:

* Understanding the workflow of fine-tuning and using pre-trained language models with the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
* Gaining practical experience with text generation techniques and parameters.
* Learning to build interactive web applications for machine learning models using Streamlit.
* Developing debugging and problem-solving skills in a complex NLP project.
* Understanding the importance of version control with Git and project documentation.

## Future Work

Potential future enhancements for this project include:

* Further fine-tuning the model with a larger and more diverse dataset to improve the mimicry of the target style.
* Exposing more generation parameters in the Streamlit app for greater user control.
* Implementing user feedback mechanisms to iteratively improve the model.
* Exploring different model architectures or fine-tuning techniques.
* Deploying the web application to a cloud platform for broader accessibility.
